For LED digits:
 1 x 5M LED strip: 300 leds 3528 12V KOUD WIT 5M 18watt total 1.5Amp total

21 x 2N3904 NPN transistor (alt: 2N2222A)
21 x 1k ohm resistors
 1 x 22uf capacitor

For 12V to 5V for raspberry pi usb power rail:
 1 x LM7805 12v to 5V (quiet hot. perhaps find alternative)
     head sync and bolt

For buttons:
 2 x push buttons

MCU
 1 x Raspberry Pi
 1 x Edimax Wifi dongle (if you want the wireless configure option)

 1 x 12v 1.2amp DC power supply
   or
 1 x 12v battery. We used YUASA 12v 2000mAh (2amp for one hour)

     will also need a charger for 12v lead acid batteries

     or https://www.amazon.de/Plug--500mA-lead-battery-charger/dp/B000NVST72/
     We used a HQ BAT-LEAD-C10HQ with 13.8v 600mA charging current.
     We also purchased two clamps that fit the connectors of the battery and DC
     female lead to create a cable that would fit and connect to the controller
     board
     
     In testing this battery lasted for several hours with all LED segments
     on ("888") and the WiFi dongle broadcasting though not in heavy use.
     Alternatively one could use 8 standard C cell alkaline batteries in series.
